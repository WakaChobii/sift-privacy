    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Why does the app say "Product Not Found"?</strong>
        Sift uses the OpenFoodFacts database, which is community-maintained. Some products — especially store brands or newer items — may not be in the database yet. Try manually searching for the product by name using the search icon on the scanner screen.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>What's the difference between Regular and Cautious mode?</strong>
        Regular mode flags ingredients that are well-established sources of gluten (wheat, barley, rye, malt, etc.) and is recommended for most people including those with celiac disease. Cautious mode also flags ambiguous ingredients like modified food starch and maltodextrin that could theoretically contain gluten but usually don't. You can change your mode anytime via the gear icon on the scanner screen.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Is Sift accurate? Can I fully trust its results?</strong>
        Sift analyzes ingredient data from OpenFoodFacts, which is community-maintained and may be incomplete or outdated. Always verify ingredients on the physical product label. Sift is an ingredient information tool, not a medical device — see the disclaimer below.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>How do I delete my scan history?</strong>
        Swipe left on any item in the History screen to delete it. To clear all app data, go to iOS Settings → Sift → Delete App.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Does Sift work offline?</strong>
        Previously scanned products are cached locally and can be viewed in your History without an internet connection. Looking up new products requires an internet connection to query the OpenFoodFacts database.
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Does Sift collect my personal data?</strong>
        No. Sift does not collect personal information, create accounts, or use analytics. Scan history is stored locally on your device only. See our <a href="https://wakachobii.github.io/sift-privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.
